											<p> Hello there!
                        I am an Audio Video programmer working for a local state college implementing new technologies to classrooms. 
                        This is a field until 5-7 years ago I never even remotely considered or thought about. 
                        I graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in Biology and realistically minimal ideas or what I wanted for myself as a career. 
                        I had ideas of working an environmental job or teaching, but never gained enough desire to truly pursue those. 
                        I was working as a cable technician for a small cable/internet provider and it was my first introduction to the technology world. 
                        As one does when they aren’t sure of next steps careerwise, 
                        I stuck with the job I had. Thankfully though a better opportunity as a research engineer came along in the form of a start-up that was attempting to develop a fingerprint sensor. 
                        This was my first taste of programming with Matlab and C#. 
                        It took me a little while to warm up to programming, but eventually I got hooked and realized I thoroughly enjoyed having a problem/need and being able to solve it through programming. 
                        The startup eventually wasn’t able to get a product out and continue operations so I was let go in a series of layoffs. 
                        Fortunately, about a year before this layoff I began serving in my church’s tech booth. 
                        I knew absolutely nothing about anything production wise, but there were needs and I was eager to meet them. 
                        I started running the lighting console, but quickly started programming the lighting scenes myself. 
                        Eventually, I was leading the production team and was familiar with all the roles and positions. As luck would have it, the sound engineer ran a local AV installation company and offered me a position when I lost my research job.
                        Unfortunately, the position was a warehouse manager handling deliveries, purchasing, and inventory. 
                        This definitely wasn’t the ideal job but I used this as a stepping stone to become an AV programmer. 
                        Even while in the warehouse position I was constantly trying to learn and show my employer that I was more beneficial in a more technical/programming role. 
                        I first would install equipment in the AV Racks, then that moved to I would set up the equipment in the AV Racks. 
                        Eventually my boss began me on my first few programming projects and gave me more opportunities to get trained.
                        While there was definitely a learning curve from the Matlab and C# to AV/Control programming I was able to continually progress now as an AV programmer. 
                        While I was incredibly grateful to my former boss, I ended up leaving the AV Installation company to pursue even higher career advancements. 
                        For the state college I am currently working at I still provide the bulk of the programming, however I now get to help design and plan out new spaces. 
                        I definitely still prefer spending my time programming, but appreciate the advancements provided to me now. 
                        I am still considering next steps and what things will look like down the road. 
                        Thank you as always for taking the time to read. I do greatly appreciate everyone for all your support. 
                         </p>
