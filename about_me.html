                </header>
                <p class="blog"> I am an Audio Video programmer working for a local state college implementing new technologies to classrooms. 
					This is a field until 5-7 years ago I never even remotely considered or thought about. 
					I graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in Biology and realistically minimal ideas or what I wanted for myself as a career. 
					I had ideas of working an environmental job or teaching, but never gained enough desire to truly pursue those. 
                </p>
				<p class="blog">
					I was working as a cable technician for a small cable/internet provider and it was my first introduction to the technology world. 
					As one does when they aren’t sure of next steps careerwise, I stuck with the job I had. 
					Thankfully though a better opportunity as a research engineer came along in the form of a start-up that was attempting to develop a fingerprint sensor. 
					This was my first taste of programming with Matlab and C#. 
					It took me a little while to warm up to programming, but eventually I got hooked and realized I thoroughly enjoyed having a problem/need and being able to solve it through programming. 
				</p>
				<p class="blog">
					The startup eventually wasn’t able to get a product out and continue operations so I was let go in a series of layoffs. 
					Fortunately, about a year before this layoff I began serving in my church’s tech booth. 
					I knew absolutely nothing about anything production wise, but there were needs and I was eager to meet them. 
					I started running the lighting console, but quickly started programming the lighting scenes myself. 
					Eventually, I was leading the production team and was familiar with all the roles and positions. 
					As luck would have it, the sound engineer ran a local AV installation company and offered me a position when I lost my research job.
				</p>
				<p class="blog">
					Unfortunately, the position was a warehouse manager handling deliveries, purchasing, and inventory. 
					This definitely wasn’t the ideal job but I used this as a stepping stone to become an AV programmer. 
					Even while in the warehouse position I was constantly trying to learn and show my employer that I was more beneficial in a more technical/programming role.
					I first would install equipment in the AV Racks, then that moved to I would set up the equipment in the AV Racks. 
					Eventually my boss began me on my first few programming projects and gave me more opportunities to get trained.
				</p>
				<p class="blog">
					While there was definitely a learning curve from the Matlab and C# to AV/Control programming I was able to continually progress now as an AV programmer. 
					While I was incredibly grateful to my former boss, I ended up leaving the AV Installation company to pursue even higher career advancements. 
					For the state college I am currently working at I still provide the bulk of the programming, however I now get to help design and plan out new spaces. 
					I definitely still prefer spending my time programming, but appreciate the advancements provided to me now. 
				</p>
				<p class="blog">
					Thank you as always for taking the time to read. 
					I do greatly appreciate everyone for all your support.
