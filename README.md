# AV_Programming_Blog

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, SASS, and JavaScript.

This site is a standard blog from the perspective of an AV programmer. It features a home page with recent blog posts, news, and a subscribe form. 
ZeroFour by HTML5 UP was used as a template, however heavy modifications were made to fit website's needs.

Future Updates/Considerations: 
1. Add in a like and comment feature (will it need a login feature?).
2. If I add in a login feature (will need a demo login).
3. Continue adding more posts.
4. Look up way to auto-update News Section using an API.
5. Create a forum page. 
6. Create a way to more easier add blog posts.
